# Old Skool Sessions Audio Player Implementation

## Current State
The audio player implementation follows a minimalist design with a large, centered play/pause button. The UI is intentionally simple to maintain focus on the audio experience.

## Technical Implementation

### Media Components
- Using AndroidX Media3 (ExoPlayer) for audio playback
- MediaSession for system-level media controls
- Custom notification manager for playback controls

### UI Components
1. **Play/Pause Button**
   - Large circular button (96dp x 96dp)
   - Black background with white icon
   - Toggles between play/pause states
   - Centered in the layout

2. **Progress Bar (Scrubber)**
   - Initially hidden on load
   - Appears when playback starts
   - Shows current playback position
   - Located below the play/pause button

## Known Issues

### Critical
1. **App Crashes on Play Button Press**
   - Root cause: Media3 initialization errors
   - Unresolved references to media components
   - Notification channel API level compatibility issues

2. **Progress Bar Visibility**
   - Non-standard implementation of scrubber visibility
   - Should follow platform conventions for media players
   - Need to standardize the show/hide behavior

## Next Steps

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **Media3 Integration**
   - Fix unresolved references to media3 components
   - Properly initialize ExoPlayer and MediaSession
   - Handle notification permissions for Android 13+

2. **Player Controls**
   - Implement standard MediaController behavior
   - Follow platform guidelines for scrubber visibility
   - Add proper error handling for media loading

3. **UI Polish**
   - Ensure consistent button states
   - Add loading indicators
   - Improve error feedback to user

## Design Notes
The current implementation attempts to match the provided mockup with a minimalist audio player. However, some Android platform conventions were overlooked in favor of custom behaviors, leading to stability issues.

### Recommendations
1. Follow standard Android media player patterns
2. Keep the clean visual design but use platform-standard behaviors
3. Implement proper state management for player controls
4. Add proper loading and error states
